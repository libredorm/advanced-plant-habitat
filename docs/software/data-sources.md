### Interconnection
most of the sensors connect to the [data hub](hub) via standard protocols such as [SPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface) or [I2C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IÂ²C),
some uses ad hoc protocols like [one wire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1-Wire),
or just a simple data line connected to a digital or analog pin.

expects to use the I2C protocol extensively to reduce pin usage on both sides
